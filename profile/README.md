# MineOnlium
This project was started with the vision of a truly fair start crypto-economy. Too many fake projects are poping up all over the place. Lets come together and build our own community without the massive whales and dev fees/pre-alloc's.

# GOD COMPLEX
It seems that the Developer https://github.com/jeffneff has developed a god complex and his talk about community is all bs.  I would recommend staying away from this project and network at all costs. Even talking about a vulnerabilaty in ETH and all forks of ETH it is believed this project was created for the developer's own personal gain.
