# MineOnlium
This project was started with the vision of a truly fair start crypto-economy. Too many fake projects are poping up all over the place. Lets come together and build our own community without the massive whales and dev fees/pre-alloc's.


This project is highly WIP and is currently in the pre-alpha stage. Over the next few months this space will change rapidly as our project grows.
